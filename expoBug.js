This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to manage an Expo project. The error message itself is vague, often providing little context. It typically manifests during build or start processes, preventing successful execution. The root cause can vary widely; it might stem from incorrect configurations (like mismatched dependencies, incorrect package.json entries, or issues with the project's build system), corrupted local caches, or problems with underlying tools or environment dependencies.  Debugging usually involves checking the console log for more specific errors, reviewing the package.json, ensuring Node.js and npm versions are compatible, and cleaning the project cache (expo prebuild --clean).
