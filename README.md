# Vague Expo CLI Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered with the Expo CLI during build or start processes. The error message is usually vague, making it difficult to pinpoint the root cause.

## Problem

The primary issue is the lack of specific error messages. This makes debugging challenging. The error might manifest during the `expo start` or `expo build` commands, halting the process without clear guidance.

## Solution

The solution involves a systematic debugging approach:

1. **Check the console logs:** Carefully examine the console for more detailed error messages, stack traces, or warnings.
2. **Review `package.json`:** Verify dependencies are correctly specified, avoiding version conflicts and ensuring all required packages are installed.
3. **Check Node.js and npm versions:** Ensure that these versions are compatible with Expo and your project's requirements.
4. **Clean the cache:** Use the command `expo prebuild --clean` to remove potential corrupted cache files.
5. **Update dependencies:** Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install the latest versions of the project dependencies.
6. **Check Environment:** Make sure you have all the required system settings such as Android SDK and Java JDK configured correctly.

This approach helps narrow down the source of the vague error.
